Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _21G.107 Chinese I (Streamlined)_ as it was taught by Min-Min Liang in Fall 2014.

This course, in combination with [_21G.108 Chinese II (Streamlined)_](/courses/21g-108-chinese-ii-streamlined-spring-2015/), constitutes the elementary level of the streamlined Chinese sequence. Taught entirely in Chinese, the course is designed for students who have basic Chinese conversational skills, but who lack a corresponding level of literacy. The focus of the course is on learning standard language usage, reading in both full and simplified characters, and writing. 

Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

*   Develop Chinese literacy skills

Instructor Insights
-------------------

{{< quote "When I first started, I knew one [teaching] method. I thought it was best to drill the students… to make them repeat. But throughout the years I realized they could say certain things, but they could not have a conversation... so I think I’ve evolved. Right now, the main [focus] for me is to have a welcoming environment to help students speak the language, not to talk about the language." "—Min-Min Liang" >}}

Student Information
-------------------

![18 students took this course when it was offered in Fall 2014.](/coursemedia/21g-107-chinese-i-streamlined-fall-2014/f80f0b0cc817690532495796be611444_21G-107_stat-students.png)

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly sophomores

### Breakdown by Major

Mostly computer science and engineering

### Typical Student Background

Students tend to be heritage language learners. Most are advanced-beginners, with a speaking level of intermediate-low. Prior to the course, many cannot read or write Chinese. Some attended “Chinese School” once a week during their childhoods, but most have forgotten what they learned during these experiences.  Many students want to learn Chinese in order to be able to converse with family members who do not speak English. They also seem to value the advantage that fluency in multiple languages offers them in a society that is becoming more globalized.

### Ideal Class Size

Having fewer than 20 students in the class allows students to have more speaking opportunities. This is important because students tend not to speak Chinese outside of class. To get the most of the course, they need to speak frequently during each class session.
